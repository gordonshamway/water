## Description
This is the acompaning documentation for the kaggle water gauge competition.
The aim of this competition is it to make predictions about the amount of water that will fall at certain spaces in the united states. 
For this prediction data from several places were collected about a amount of time. 
detailed descriptions could be found under the following link: XXX

A special topic in this competition is the falsified data that is providd in the competition. It is crucial for this competition to rightify the data for getting correct results. 

Data should be scanned to find values that are not in specified ranges and also complete cases should be checked. 

## Loading the stuff

```{r}
#train = data.table(read.csv("./Raw_Data/train.csv", header = TRUE))
test = data.table(read.csv("./Raw_Data/test.csv", header = TRUE))

library(h2o)
library(data.table)
library(Metrics)
h2o.init(nthreads=-1)

## use data table to only read the Estimated, Ref, and Id fields
print(paste("reading training file:",Sys.time()))
train<-fread("./Raw_Data/train.csv",select=c(1,4,24))

#Cut off outliers of Expected >= 70
train <- subset(train, Expected < 69)

trainHex<-as.h2o(train[,.(
  meanRef = mean(Ref,na.rm=T),
  sumRef = sum(Ref,na.rm=T),
  records = .N,
  naCounts = sum(is.na(Ref)),
  target = log1p(mean(Expected))
),Id][records>naCounts,],destination_frame="train.hex")

test<-fread("../input/test.csv",select=c(1,4))
testHex<-as.h2o(test[,.(
  meanRef = mean(Ref,na.rm=T),
  sumRef = sum(Ref,na.rm=T),
  records = .N,
  naCounts = sum(is.na(Ref))
),Id],destination_frame="test.hex")

regression_model <- h2o.deeplearning(x=1:5, y=6, training_frame=trainHex, 
                                     hidden=c(10,10,10), epochs=10000, activation="RectifierWithDropout")

predictions <- h2o.predict(regression_model, testHex)

submission <-fread("../input/sample_solution.csv")
predictions<-as.data.frame(predictions)
submission$Expected <- expm1(as.data.frame(predictions)$predict)*0.5 + submission$Expected*0.5

write.csv(submission,"../output/deeplearning_v1.csv",row.names=F)
```
